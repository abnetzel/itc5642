<h2>Name</h2>
<p>Amy Netzel</p>
<h2>Interests</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Kayaking</strong>. I'm in the process of purchasing my own gear.</li>
  <li><strong>Movies</strong>. Who doesn't enjoy a good movie out? I like super hero films (the Marvel Univerise is amazing, but so is the story in Will Smith's Hancock and who knew that Deadpool would be a love story?). I also enjoy Japanese animation out of Studio Ghibli, as well as comedies, documentaries, and really...just about anything!</li>
  <li><strong>Horseback riding</strong>. I don't get to do enough of it, but I used to train in Dressage.</li>
  <li><strong>Video production</strong>. I love all aspects of it! Planning for, filming, animating, screencasting, live action, green screen, lighting...you name it!</li>
  <li><strong>Accessibility training and coaching</strong>. It is my joy to assist a faculty member as he works his way through retrofitting content, such as an inaccessible Word document and hear him say, &quot;I should really do this from the start; that'll help me save time!&quot; Job well done, Amy.</li>
  <li><strong>Travelling</strong>. At this point, this is an unfulfilled interest. When I have vacation, it is to travel from NC to WI to see my family. I've lamented that this well-worn path has been my vacation route for well over a decade and I'd love to have them travel with me to somewhere else. Anywhere else! Though I'd love to take part in an ol' fashioned cattle drive, out west.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Hobbies</h2>
<p>When I'm not making videos, I do arts and craftsy type stuff: crocheting, painting, perler beads, etc. But I'm working on rolling out a newYouTube series (Teaching Demystified) on September 5th, so video production has, at the moment, been my main  hobby!</p>
<h2>About Me</h2>
